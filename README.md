## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [project-name]
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   cd node && npm install
   cd ../react && npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the root directory
   - Fill in the required environment variables, especially the MongoDB URI

4. Start the development servers:
   - For backend: `cd node && npm run dev`
   - For frontend: `cd react && npm run dev`

## Running with Docker

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.

2. For development:

   ```docker
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up
   ```

3. For production:

   ```docker
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
   ```

## Testing

- Backend tests: `cd node && npm test`
- Frontend tests: `cd react && npm test`

## Linting and Formatting

- Lint backend: `cd node && npm run lint`
- Lint frontend: `cd react && npm run lint`
- Format project: `npm run prettier` (from root directory)

## Project Documentation

- Use the `docs/` directory for project-wide documentation
- The `project/` directory contains files for project management:
  - `ProjectChecklist.md`: Track project milestones and tasks
  - `ProjectJournal.md`: Keep a development journal
  - `ProjectNotes.md`: Misc. project-related notes
